# FaceNet
Implementation of Prototypical Networks as a face verification system

Used the [Prototypical Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.05175) model as a face verification system

Currently I just finished training and verifying results, so I havent yet added code to automatically download datasets and so on. All that will be done. 
I will also add an option to use pretrained weights directly.
